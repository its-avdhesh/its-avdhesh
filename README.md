# 👋 Hey there, I'm Avdhesh Singh Bhadoriya

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer who believes that a well-written line of code is just like a good joke — it needs no explanation (unless it crashes). From turning caffeine into code to debugging my life choices, I strive to build innovative and practical solutions using technology.

I'm currently diving deep into JavaScript, React, and Node.js, building projects that make people go "Whoa, that actually works?" I believe in clean, maintainable code — although my console.log statements may suggest otherwise.

My software journey is a thrilling rollercoaster of feature deployments, debugging marathons, and the occasional victory dance when things work on the first try. Collaboration excites me, so if you've got a quirky project idea or a meme-worthy bug, count me in.

## 🚀 Tech Stack I Work With
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST API
- **Database:** MongoDB, SQL
- **Tools:** Postman, Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code

## 🧑‍💻 A Few Things About Me
- 🐞 Debugging my code and sometimes my life.
